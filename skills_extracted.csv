Why Cisco

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here's how we do it.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we're ""old"" (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we're also a software company. And a security company. A block-chain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do - you can't put us in a box! But ""Digital Transformation"" is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.",Bangalore,"₹ 12,19,884","Automation,UDP,Network security,Firewall,Routers,DNA,Programming,Linux,Security management,CS,USD,ASA,Software,IPS,Python,Switches,NXOS,Transformation,Security,Agile,TCP,QA"

Job Description

Now is a unique moment to join Airbus Defense and Space activities in India !

The space and defence industry is facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges in a world that is becoming more complex and less predictable. For instance, deploying payloads into space is becoming much cheaper, which opens up space to new commercial users and entrepreneurial business models.Unmanned aerial vehicles (“drones”) provide deep insight into the well-being of our fragile planet, and allow delivery of payloads into areas that are too dirty, dull or dangerous for human pilots.Drones also hold promise for moving people around congested cities.Meanwhile, the ramifications of conflicts around the world stretch all the way to the core of affluent Western democracies, both offline and online.Threats to critical infrastructure, payment systems and mainstream media for instance illustrate the asymmetric nature of many conflicts, requiring better security and protection in cyberspace.Meanwhile, governments are striving to improve the total cost of ownership of their existing military assets, such as military aircraft.They are also increasingly buying new assets as a service, in the process forcing a business model transformation upon their suppliers.

The Digital Platform which is being created now at Airbus Defence & Space is a crucial foundation for these transformations, as it enables promising internal and external use cases that improve operational performance, open up new markets, and ultimately contribute to making the world a safer place.

Your Role

As a member of our growing DevOps Engineering team, your responsibility is the day to day development and continuous enhancement of the Airbus Digital Platform as a Service (PaaS)

and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) layer to meet the demands of our business.

To be successful, you must have an automation-first mindset and deep expert knowledge in one of the core technical domains of our platform (Cloud, Container Orchestration, Big Data, API Management) as well as sound knowledge in one of the other areas. In your role, you are part of a scrum development team and build services jointly with members of other disciplines.

Your Responsibilities/Tasks

Implement new Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and Platform as a Service (PaaS) elements defined by the platform architecture team.

Ensure a smooth transition into operations to meet expected SLAs. Improve existing IaaS/PaaS elements based on customer feedback, market trends, and runtime information.Continuously increase the automation level and resilience of the IaaS/PaaS layer, i.e. in terms of self-healing capabilities and zero-touch deployment. Harden the IaaS/PaaS layer continuously against evolving threats in close collaboration with the security team.
